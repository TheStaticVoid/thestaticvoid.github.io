            <h1>Spacetech Info</h1>

            <div id="item-text-r">
                <p> This is a pretty complex datapack. I will just put what
                    the creator has on the original page.<br><br>
                    SpaceTech is a datapack aimed at providing endgame 
                    players with additional tools and utilities for 
                    exploration and building convenience.<br><br>
                    <b>Microcapsules</b>: These are the core gameplay of SpaceTech. 
                    They are craftable custom heads that once dropped onto 
                    the ground will spawn a structure, no building required.<br><br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Capsules are crafted in a dispenser, and can only 
                        be crafted one at a time (multiple items in the 
                        same slot will not work). To receive the capsule 
                        you must stand on top of the dispenser containing 
                        the ingredients. Note that all recipes use "block 
                        of quartz" - not smooth quartz.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Each type of capsule has a unique shaped recipe. 
                        Images of each recipe are provided in the spoiler 
                        below and in the datapack file for your convenience.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        For the capsule to activate, simply drop it on the 
                        ground and have all players stand back. The structure 
                        will spawn centered on the block the capsule is placed, 
                        facing north. They will overwrite blocks in their 
                        spawning area so be sure to give them plenty of space!
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        If you accidentally place a capsule instead of 
                        dropping it, break it - the datapack will reassign 
                        the necessary nbt data
                    </li><br>
                </ul>

                        <b>Aquariam Tank</b>:A water-filled tank for all your 
                        water needs on the go, even in the nether. Also works 
                        for capturing aquatic mobs.

                        <b>Containment Units (small and large versions)</b>: 
                        Think of these as throwable cages, but with a 
                        futuristic look. Simply throw at the mob you'd like 
                        to capture, and stand back. Each spawns with a beacon 
                        for easy locating.

                <h2>Teleporter Info</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Teleporters are spawned the same way as other structures: drop a capsule, stand back, and the teleporter will spawn ready to use
                    </li><br>
                    Each teleporter has 2 configurable settings:
                    <li>
                        <i>Channel (frequency)</i>: The color of the 
                        teleporter, adjust by rotating the item in the 
                        item frame above "Channel" for a total of 8 colors 
                        (white, red, orange, yellow, lime, green, blue, purple).
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <i>Destination</i>: The color of the teleporter you 
                        wish to teleport to, adjust by rotating the item 
                        in the item frame above "Destination".
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        To teleport, at least 2 teleporters must be placed 
                        somewhere in your world, and they must be set to 
                        different channels. Once at least 2 teleporters 
                        are configured, set your destination to an existing 
                        teleporter, stand on the diamond block (make sure 
                        you aren't on a slab instead) and press the stone 
                        button above "Destination".
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        To remove/deactivate a teleporter, place an obsidian 
                        block on top of the glass block that is above the 
                        beacon. This will remove the armorstands and item 
                        frames, and the teleporter can be safely removed.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        You can set up to 8 teleporters (one for each color 
                        channel). While spawning more is possible, it is not 
                        recommended as unexpected behavior may occur.
                    </li><br>
