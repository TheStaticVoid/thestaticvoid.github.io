            <h1>Rules</h1>

            <p> Rules aren't fun, we all can agree on that, but to ensure
                an enjoyable experience for all players, there are some
                simple rules I expect everyone to follow.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    No griefing. Yes, Factions is included in the server, but
                    it does not mean you can grief someone else's base.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Do not abuse any exploits, bugs, or glitches in Minecraft
                    for any gain.<br>
                    <b>NO CHEATING / CHEAT CLIENTS</b>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Use of derogatory terms on the basis of race are not
                    allowed. Just be civil in your chats.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Combat logging and teleporting out of combat are not
                    allowed, even if you are the one being attacked first.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Faction wars should be kept to a minimum, only resulting
                    from failing to compromise in a civil way.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Base raids are only allowed when members of a faction are
                    currently online. Offline raiders will be punished.
                </li><br>
