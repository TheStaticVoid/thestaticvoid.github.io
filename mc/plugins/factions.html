            <h1>Factions Info</h1>
            <p> If you are familiar with the old version of the Factions
                plugin, you might as well throw that knowledge out the door.
                This plugin is an extension of the original plugin, but with a
                lot new added features and significant changes in the operation
                of the plugin.
                <br>
                This plugin allows for claiming chunks and creating groups to
                protect your valuables from being disturbed by others.
                <br>
                By default, each player contributes <b>30 power</b> to his/her
                faction. This means one person can claim 30 chunks for
                themselves.
                <br>
                <b>Innapropriate faction names will be removed.</b>
                <br><br>

                <code>/f</code> — Allows for access to the basic factions menu.
                I highly recommend scanning through this and seeing what is
                available for you to use.

                <code>/f map</code> — Shows all claims in a radius around you.
                You can click the unclaimed regions to claim them for your own
                faction. Please do not click too fast, otherwise you could get
                kicked for "spamming."
                
                <code>/f inv username</code> — to invite your friends to your
                faction. They can accept your invite by using:
                <code>/f join factionname</code>
            </p>
