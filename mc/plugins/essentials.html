            <h1>EssentialsX Info</h1>
            <p> What's there to be said about Essentials. This is a plugin that
                has been around since the dawn of Bukkit plugins. It
                encompasses most of the "essential" commands needed for a
                Minecraft server. Here are some of the commands you may want
                to keep in mind when using this plugin.<br><br>

                <code>/help</code> — Self explanatory, it shows you all the
                commands that you currently have permission to use. You can
                also use the syntax <code>/help pluginname</code> to get more
                commands specific to a certain plugin.<br><br>

                <code>/home</code> and <code>/sethome</code> — these are two
                of the most useful commands available to you. This allows you
                to set a home that you can teleport back to freely. Great for
                not having to worry about going thousands of blocks out and
                having to come all the way back. To avoid abuse, I have
                implemented a cooldown on how often this can be used, and there
                is a warmup period where you have to stand still before
                teleporting.<br><br>

                <code>/spawn</code> — this command works similar to
                <code>/home</code>, but it instead takes you to the server's
                spawn. This is useful as all the shops on the server are
                located at spawn.<br><br>

                <code>/sell</code> — This allows you to sell items to the
                server. Currently, we are using a purely physical economy,
                with Dragon Eggs being the item to convert from physical to
                the digital economy. The purpose of this is to allow for
                purchasing faction upgrades.<br><br>

                <code>/ptime</code> and <code>/pweather</code> — these commands
                allow you to change your local time and weather respectively.
                These do not affect mob spawning, so be warned.
